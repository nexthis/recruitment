# Clarification

Some issues that need clarification

- eslint and prettier -> I have only done minimal configuration and I am not paying attention to refining these modules because the project is only for demonstration purposes.
- pagination -> In a normal situation, I would add a pagination system, but then almost the entire filtering would be done on the backend side rather than the frontend side
